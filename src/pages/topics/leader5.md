## LEADER - Effective Communication

### The Situation – Why

The leaders who take the time to develop the skills of communication are the
ones who will be able to effectively lead a company or an organization. Many of
the problems that arise in an organization is due to poor communication or just
simply the lack of communication to their employees. This creates uncertainty
and misinformation to spread. Good communication also involved learning how to
listen more effectively so that then needs of the people are heard. All these
things will either help the organization to advance or stay at the same place.
Therefore, it is vital that every leader grows in being a better communicator.
They must learn how to communicate with clarity and simplicity so that those
who are following them can move forward together in accomplishing the vision
and mission.

### The Solution – What We Offer

Globalplex will work with the leader in order to lay down a strong foundation
on the principles of communication, as well as developing the competencies and
skills required to communicate the vision, mission, and values of the company
so that the anticipated goals can be realized.

1. **Knowing your why's.** When it comes to good and effective communication,
   it all comes down to knowing your whys so that when things are shared with
   other, people will understand; therefore, Globalplex will assist in
   understanding your whys and then articulating it clearly.
2. **Communication for change.** For most leaders, when certain things are
   communicated, they want to see specific changes so that the shared mission
   and goals can be reached; therefore, Globalplex will teach and train the
   leader how to communicate with the end goal in mind and to motivate people
   towards making a difference.
3. **Speaking and writing with clarity.** There are different ways to
   communicate a message and now in this digital age, it is critical that a
   leader knows how to better communicate when they speak in front of people,
   as well as, when they are writing a letter or an email; therefore,
   Globalplex will help the leader improve in speaking and in writing with
   clarity so that their employees will know exactly what is being conveyed.
4. **Non-verbal communication.** Since, over 90% of all communication is
   non-verbal through our body language and tone, it is important that the
   leader understands and develops a better non-verbal communication style;
   therefore, Globalplex will train up the leader to observe and practice the
   important skills of non-verbal communication.
5. **Active listening and awareness.** Leaders are hindered in communicating
   important and needed information because they are not aware of the situation
   around them which causes them to feel distant from their employees,
   therefore, Globalplex is committed to helping the leader acquire the
   necessary tools to grow in active listening and awareness.
