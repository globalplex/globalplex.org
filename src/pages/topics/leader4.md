## LEADER - Development of Character

### The Situation – Why

Our character is the container that carries our conviction. It is also the
channel in which we are able to lead people with integrity and faithfulness.
Many of the problems and collapse of companies and organization can be pointed
back to an ethical issue or a character issue of the leader. But too often,
people are more focused on competencies rather than on the character of a
leader because the focus is so much on the results and the bottom line.
Nevertheless, if there are more leaders who have solid character, then we will
see companies and organizations thrive and flourish. For that reason, character
is something that has to be built over a period of time, which means that the
leader has to commit to the process and be diligent in forming their character.

### The Solution – What We Offer

Globalplex will identify a specific set of character traits that are needed in
order for the leader to have influence on the people they are leading, then
there will be a developmental chart which will be designed specifically for the
areas that the leaders want to develop.

1. **Passion and purpose.** In order for a leader to see the importance of
   developing their character, they have to see their purpose in life, as well
   as, to know what they are passionate about; therefore, Globalplex will
   provide different resources for the leader to understand and construct a
   clear purpose statement and discover more of their passions.
2. **Integrity and honesty.** Since, integrity and honesty are often times
   associated together with having "good character," it is vital that a leader
   makes a commitment to develop these traits; therefore, Globalplex will
   instruct the leader with some basic steps to work on growing stronger in
   integrity and honesty.
3. **Proactiveness and Responsibility.** It is within our human nature to be
   idle and passive, especially when things are not under our responsibility
   because we have no ownership of what needs to be done; therefore, Globalplex
   wants to help work on growing in being more responsible and learn the skills
   of proactiveness.
4. **Courage and commitment.** Good leadership requires a person to have a high
   level of commitment in what they do and to be able to courageously make
   tough decisions, even if that means others will not be happy; therefore,
   Globalplex will not only lay a good foundation for growing in courage but to
   address issues that cause us to be fearful.
5. **Servanthood.** The best leaders in any company or organization are servant
   leaders, who are willing to put others first and helps empower people to
   reach their full potential; therefore, Globalplex will instruct the leader
   to develop the mindset of a servant, as well as, to train in meeting the
   needs of the people in the organization.
