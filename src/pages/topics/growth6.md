## GROWTH - Healthy Habits

### Why

In an increasingly connected and busy world, workers in many fields complain
about working themselves "to death" in an attempt to "have it all." While the
phrase is often meant as hyperbole, studies continue to find that heavy
workloads, family stressors, decreased free time and unhealthy personal habits
really are dangerous for our health.

While many of us recognize that our work-life balance is anything but balanced,
it can be challenging — and sometimes feels impossible — to change deeply
ingrained habits. Creating a healthy work-life balance is different for
everyone, but working professionals can succeed at work while also enjoying
family time, school and other activities by taking small steps to incorporate
healthy habits into our daily lives.

### How

We focus on 3 different areas:
