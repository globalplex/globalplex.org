## IMPACT - Planning with Creativity and Innovation

### Why

- **The #1 skill that the [World Economic
  Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/top-10-work-skills-of-tomorrow-how-long-it-takes-to-learn-them/)
  lists as the Top 10 skills of 2025 is analytical thinking and innovation.**

No matter what industry your team belongs to, creativity and innovation are key
ingredients in the planning process to effectively impact the society and your
stakeholders. Sometimes, teams are locked into doing "whatever we have done in
the past" or "because it has always been this way." These are some default
planning pitfalls that not only prevent teams from progressing, but push
organizations toward extinction. As technologies are constantly evolving and
generational paradigms are constantly shifting, teams need to learn how to plan
and forecast into the future with boldness, creativity, and innovation for
their products and team missions to move forward. With our training, we will
provide teams with the tools to translate their mission into actionable plans
with creative and innovation.

### What We Offer

#### Overcoming Fear of Failure / Risk-taking

One of the biggest hindrances for teams to plan with creativity and innovation
is fear of failure and inability to take risks. Especially for those who grew
up in Asia and come from shame-based cultures, people often translate their
failures into their identity as failures. Teams are no different. This type of
mindset is one of the main reasons teams lack movement forward. In our
training, we will address frameworks that help people understand the root of
their fear of failure, as well as how language, culture, and structures of
teams might affect a team's overall sentiment towards failure and risk-taking.
Uncovering these "weeds" of teams will help teams move forward in actually
thriving in their creativity and innovation.

#### Design & Divergent Thinking Models

Design thinking models are not limited to teams that are tasked to design. We
believe that all teams can benefit and learn from design thinking models that
focus on solving problems at its core. Through experiential and hands-on
learning activities, we will equip teams on how to identify core problems or
needs in their industry and apply design thinking models to come up with
creative and innovative, out-of-the-box solutions. Divergent thinking exercises
will also be provided for individuals and teams as a whole to grow in their
ability to develop ideas.
