## IMPACT - Teamwork Strategies

### How

Not one team looks the same, because different teams have different functions,
dynamics, and members. In our training on teamwork strategies, we will help
teams understand the unique nature of their team and how it falls under general
categories of teams. Then, we will provide customized consultation for that
team's strategy based on their objectives, roles, and structures.

### What We Offer

#### Assessment & Analysis of Team Status

To apply the most applicable strategies for developing your team for impact, we
will provide a quantitative and qualitative assessment of your team's current
state. This includes individual questionnaires and interviews of your members
to understand the overall sentiment of the team's dynamics, skills, and
productivity. The assessment will provide metrics on how effective
collaboration dynamics within team members are, how individual members' skills
are utilized and maximized, and the stage in which the team is able to produce
impactful results.

#### Customized Training Materials

Based on our assessment, we will then provide a customized and tailor-made
training package for your team to further develop and provide actionable
follow-up plans to help your team continue to excel after our training has
concluded. These strategies and frameworks will be provided in order to
effectively equip your team as a whole and each member of the team to take the
training materials and apply it into the work context with accountability to
ensure sustainable growth and team development for maximum impact.
