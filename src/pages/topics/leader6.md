## LEADER - Relational Proficiency

### The Situation – Why

When there is a problem in a team or in an organization, it is usually
relational by nature. This is why all good leaders must be able to understand
and work with people in a comprehensive way. Learning how to manage people,
build cross-functional relationships, and address conflicts constructively and
effectively are all skills that will help the leader be more productive in
bringing people together. Therefore, leaders must diligently and thoroughly
work on building trust with their employees and those that they are working
with in order to better strengthen the collaboration and partnership. By having
the acquired relational proficiencies, the leader will be able to help the
organization to accomplish more of the vision and mission.

### The Solution – What We Offer

Globalplex will take a relational approach by personally training and coaching
to develop the leader in the necessary areas of relational proficiencies so
that they can be more prepared to work with others and inspire people towards
the fulfillment of the organization's mission.

1. **Emotional Intelligence.** When to comes to intelligence, we have a
   tendency to focus on a person's IQ and how much they know, which might not
   necessarily be the best indicator of a person's success because so much of
   life is based on relationships; therefore, Globalplex will help assess and
   develop a leader's emotional intelligence in order for them to work well
   with others.
2. **Basic social skills.** There are a lot of things that are taught and there
   are some things that are caught which is why learning how to be more adept
   and proficient in social skills requires practice; therefore, Globalplex
   will implement various one-on-one and group setting scenarios to increase
   the social aptitude.
3. **Conflict management.** There will always be relational conflicts when we
   are working with others which is why learning how to have good conflict
   management skills is a priority; therefore, Globalplex will work with the
   leader to familiarize with various conflict situations and practice knowing
   how to resolve the conflict and bring a consensus to the situation.
4. **Inspiring and motivating people.** Good leaders all understand the
   importance of inspiring and motivating people to do things that they might
   not normally want to do so that the greater mission and vision can be
   accomplished; therefore, Globalplex will train the leader in the basic
   skills in communicating, challenging, and captivating people towards a
   desired outcome.
5. **Learning the skills of networking.** It is understood that no person or
   organization is an island to themselves, but rather there it is a series of
   connections that are made with others who have helped us and gave us
   opportunities; therefore, Globalplex will instruct and train the leader with
   skills to better network with others in various contexts to mutually help
   others.
