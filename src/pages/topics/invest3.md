## INVEST - Vision Setting

> **"Vision without action is merely a dream. Action without vision just passes
> the time. Vision with action can change the world."**
>
> Joel A. Barker, futurist and author

Have you ever traveled to a foreign place without a GPS or any sense of
direction? It may be enjoyable in the beginning, being surprised by things you
encounter along the way with a flexible schedule. However, as days or even
years pass by, we long for some kind of clarity of where we're heading towards.
Similar to companies having a vision and mission statement, having a vision for
our lives means that we can have a clearer sense of purpose. Vision gives us
direction and helps us make wise decisions that align with our passion and
purpose in life. It helps us avoid any unnecessary distractions that derail us
from what we desire to achieve or accomplish with the one life we have on
earth.
