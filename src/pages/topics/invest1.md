## INVEST - Intrinsically Motivated

> **"I want to make beautiful things, even if nobody cares."**

Before we begin anything in life - working on a project, joining a gym
membership, starting a healthy diet plan - we have to first be motivated to do
so, and this motivation needs to come from within you so that it can be
durable. If we were only given a task to complete simply because we were told
to do so, the motivation would only last as long as the external rewards (e.g.
salary, praise from others) remain. However, if you are intrinsically
motivated, you are usually inherently enjoying what you are doing, no matter
how much or little external support you have. This is the kind of intrinsic
motivation we are looking for before we go in depth about what Integrative
Personal Transformation looks like.
