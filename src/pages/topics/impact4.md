## IMPACT - Active Learning Strategies

### Why

Teams that strive for constant improvement are teams that inspire. Just as
individuals are encouraged to grow and keep developing, teams are also
encouraged to grow together and constantly evolve for better results and
improved dynamics. One of the best ways to learn as teams is to do active and
on-the-ground evaluation from shared experiences. Active learning strategies
are necessary so that members of teams are proactive in the learning process
rather than passively waiting for something to initiate growth or change. Not
only do teams benefit when they grow and develop together, but personal members
should also grow in their roles and functions in teams. That is why our
training will talk about personal evaluations frameworks for individual team
members as well as evaluation structures for maximum growth for whole teams.

### What We Offer

#### Personal Evaluation for Team Members

Often, personal development evaluations for employees or team members stop at
focusing on the specific tasks or competencies of the individual team members.
Although this is a vital part of personal evaluation, evaluation is also needed
for team members' effectiveness as a part of the team holistically. In our
training, we will provide frameworks that help team members evaluate and set
actionable next steps for themselves in both their personal competencies and
their function in the team. We will also provide structures for training
(e.g., "WHAT" Principle) that help team members develop in their roles on the
team.

#### Team Evaluation Structures for Growth

We will also provide different mechanisms and frameworks for teams to evaluate
on their effectiveness. Sometimes the problem with team evaluations is that
teams come up with a laundry list of need-improvements, but never look at it,
think about it, or act upon it after the discussion. This causes teams to set
themselves up for discouragement for next time and prevents teams from actually
learning and growing from their mistakes or past experiences. In our training,
our structures for evaluation will equip members of the team to strive for
improvement for their team while avoiding groupthink at the same time.
