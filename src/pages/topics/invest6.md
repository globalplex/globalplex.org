## INVEST - Tenacity

> **"Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were
> to success when they gave up."**

> Thomas A. Edison, American inventor and businessman

As we live in a world of instant gratification, it is getting harder and harder
for us to patiently persevere until we are able to achieve what we hope for. We
easily give up and find alternative methods or even shortcuts to reduce the
duration that is required for change. Tenacity is one of the most important
traits we should be equipped with in order to thrive if we are serious about
personal transformation. It is beyond merely being motivated, but developing
the grit to move forward with a positive mindset despite any difficulties
encountered along the journey of pursuing a particular goal or achievement.
