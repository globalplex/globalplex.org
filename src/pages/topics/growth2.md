## GROWTH - Relational and Social Skills

### Why

Relational skills are critical for resolving non-business-task related issues
in the workplace. These are skills that we use regularly when we interact with
other people. They're the skills that make relationships work, hence the name.

Relational skills are necessary any time you interact with another person,
whether that's a family member or a team member. As such, they're pretty
important in the workplace. They have a direct impact on a broad array of
activities, ranging from being able to collaborate with a team member to
actively listening to the concerns of someone you manage.

Without strong relational skills, the workplace simply ceases to function
properly. The good news is that strong skills can be developed through active
practice.
