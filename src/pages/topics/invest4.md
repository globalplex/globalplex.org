## INVEST - Empathy

> **"You can only understand people if you feel them in yourself."**

Empathy is a powerful skill. According to scientific studies across many types
of mammals from the smallest rodents to human beings, data suggests that we are
profoundly shaped by our social environment and that we suffer greatly when our
social bonds are threatened or severed. We, as human beings, are wired to
connect.

By showing empathy, we have to look beyond ourselves and begin to step into the
shoes of those around you. Being more other-focused helps us to relate with
others better, which leads to greater trust and loyalty. In professional
settings, being able to see from your business partners' perspectives helps you
become more effective in your communication and come up with win-win solutions.
On the other hand, research has also shown that by empathizing with others, the
close bonds we form with others help us develop healthy coping mechanisms
towards stress. Transformation and growth can only happen if you are willing to
open up yourself to interact and relate with people around you.
