Management is not just for managers or bosses. We all manage, and each of us
plays a role in management in our lives. Traditionally, people see
self-management as time management, where one is considered a good self-manager
as long as his or her work gets done on time. In the modern working world,
managing your time well is expected. Self management is about taking
responsibility for your own life! It is to be your best self, not merely only
for the betterment of your own life, but for your team, your company, and
wherever else you have an influence on.
