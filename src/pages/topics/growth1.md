## GROWTH - Growth Mindset

### Why

One of the most basic beliefs we carry about ourselves has to do with how we
view and inhabit what we consider to be our personality. A "fixed mindset"
assumes that our character, intelligence, and creative ability are static
givens that we can't change in any meaningful way, and success is the
affirmation of that inherent intelligence. Therefore, striving for success and
avoiding failure at all costs become a way of maintaining the sense of being
smart or skilled. A "growth mindset," on the other hand, thrives on challenge
and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening
springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities. Out of these
two mindsets, which we manifest from a very early age, springs a great deal of
our behavior, our relationship with success and failure in both professional
and personal contexts, and ultimately our capacity for happiness.

### How

Having a growth mindset means:

- Intelligence can be developed
- Desire to learn and embrace challenges
- Persistence in the face of setbacks
- See effort as the path to mastery, learn from criticism
- Find lessons and inspiration in the success of others
- Reach ever-higher levels of achievements and pursuits of happiness in life
- A greater sense of free will
