## LEADER - Leadership Acumen

### The Situation – Why

The false belief is that a person is born with leadership abilities, but the
reality is that leadership capabilities and skills can be developed. When a
person commits to cultivating their leadership aptitude and competencies, they
will be more effective in leading others and their teams. The transformative
implementation of leadership competencies will lay a strong foundation for
leading your most important asset, which are your people. Then you will be able
to influence and impact your teams more effectively.

### The Solution – What We Offer

they are working with so that the targets and objectives can be reached.

1. **Foundations of Transformative Leadership.** Since it is imperative that
   every leader understands the basics of leadership (the why, the how, and the
   what) before they try to influence others and transform any organization,
   Globalplex will help lay the leadership foundation.
2. **Understanding Leadership Styles.** It is critical that that every leader
   understands their leadership style with their strengths and weaknesses,

   essential leadership competencies (The 3 D's: Direction-giving,
   Decision-making, Delegation-enabling) so that the leader can be equipped to
   lead well; and this will be accomplished by identifying the strengths and
   the shortcomings on core competencies and applying practical training to
   increase effectiveness.
4. **The Pitfalls of Leadership.** All leaders must avoid various pitfalls in
   leading their organization forward, therefore, Globalplex will address some
   of the pitfalls and also help train the leader to have a mindset that will
   prepare them for future success, even while facing different challenges
   along the way.
5. **Leading Through Change and Crisis.** When organizations are faced with
   challenges during a crisis, it is important that leaders know how to respond
   quickly, effectively, and clearly; therefore, Globalplex will help develop
   the skills need to navigate any change or crisis that they will have to
   confront.
