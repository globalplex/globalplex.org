## LEADER - Empowered Teamwork

### The Situation – Why

So many companies and organizations are hindered in achieving their target
goals because they do not take the time to build a good team culture. When
teams fail to work together for a common mission, there are usually a lot of
negative traits (distrust, control issues, fear, and etc.) that are not
addressed and allowed to saturate in the team. The erosion of good teamwork can
even affect people's productiveness and their relationship with one another.
Therefore, leaders must be equipped to know how to work on creating healthy
dynamics, as well as, empowering their team to achieve the goals.

### The Solution – What We Offer

Globalplex will help assess and work with the leader so that a healthy dynamic
for the team can be produced and they will be more effective in accomplishing
the team's goals together.

1. **The Traits of an Incredible Team.** The more a leader understands the
   vital traits of a great team, the more they will know what the next steps
   will be for fostering a healthy and effective team, therefore, Globalplex
   will help lay down the foundation and train in the basics of team
   development and team momentum.
2. **Creating Good Synergy and Unity.** In order for teams to achieve great
   things, they always possess good synergy and unity with what they are
   created to do, therefore, Globalplex will observe the team's dynamics and
   work with everyone on the team, so that community and teamwork will be
   built.
3. **Release Your People for Success.** There are many teams that are filled
   with people who feel as if they are not empowered to make decisions and
   encumbered from moving the company's mission forward, therefore, Globalplex
   will train the leader to trust their employees and release them to
   accomplish the goals.
4. **The Art of Feedback.** Whenever there is a breakdown of communication and
   expectations between the leader and the employees, regrettable things are
   bound to happen; therefore, Globalplex will help develop the skills for
   better communication, as well as, learning how to give good feedback to
   align everyone's expectations and quality of work that is being produced.
5. **Building Team Momentum.** When a team has momentum on their side, they are
   able to undertake and complete a lot of things, but when there is a lack of
   momentum, the team will not be impeded from achieving what is expected;
   therefore, Globalplex will equip the leader to detect, build, and maximum
   the momentum for the team's advantage.
