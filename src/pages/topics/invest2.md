The "North Star" - also known as Polaris - is famous for holding nearly still
in our sky while the entire northern sky moves around it
([EarthSky](https://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/polaris-the-present-day-north-star)).
The reason Polaris is so important is because the axis of Earth is pointed
almost directly at it. During the course of the night, Polaris does not rise or
set, but remains in very nearly the same spot above the northern horizon
year-round while the other stars circle around it
([Space.com](https://www.space.com/15567-north-star-polaris.html)).

We define the "North Star Character Traits" as a set of character traits that
anchors how you live your life and make decisions. These character traits are
unique to each individual. They do not only direct your own life, but when
lived out, also inspire and influence others to be anchored in them as well.
Essentially, these are your unique set of core values that drive your everyday
living. What do you believe in? What are your hot buttons? What are some
non-negotiables in your life? These are what defines you, and in your journey
of integrative personal transformation, it cannot be done unless you know your
"North Star" that anchors your life.
