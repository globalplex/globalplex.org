## LEADER - Attitude of a Leader

### The Situation – Why

As it has been famously quoted, "our attitude will determine our altitude."
Many leaders forget about the power of their attitude and how it can affect
their role as a leader. The leader's attitude has the power to affect the
people that they work with, as well as, their ability to achieve what they need
to do. Therefore, the attitude of a leader must be addressed. There needs to be
solutions in order to work on having a positive attitude and go beyond the
expected responses to various situation. The leader will learn how to work on
their internal mindset, along with practical skills of responding in an
optimistic and confident manner so that they can inspire and lead their team
well.

### The Solution – What We Offer

Globalplex will work with the leader and help identity and assess some of the
thought process and built-in response mechanisms which hinder them from
achieving their desired goals; then they will be trained to re-learn how to
respond in a positive way.

1. **Positivity & Confidence.** A negative mindset tends to hinder people from
   advancing forward towards their future success because it taints the way we
   approach people and our responsibilities; therefore, Globalplex will work
   the leader to build a positive attitude and a strong sense of confidence in
   the things that they are called to do.
2. **Humility & Gratitude.** It is easy to overlook and neglect some the basic
   traits of humility and gratitude, which have made people success in life and
   in the workplace throughout history; therefore, Globalplex will coach the
   leader to not only see the importance of these traits but to also come up
   with a strategy to cultivate a heart of gratitude and humility.
3. **Empathy & Compassion.** The greater the levels of empathy and compassion
   that a leader possesses, the more effective they will be in leading people
   and their teams; therefore, Globalplex will guide and help nurture these
   important character traits through various role playing and situational
   scenarios to develop greater empathy and compassion in their leadership.
4. **Grit & perseverance.** There are many challenges that a leader faces when
   it comes to leading people or a team and it is easy to lose sight of the end
   goal, which causes us to give up and get discouraged; therefore, Globalplex
   will instruct and assist in improving the leader's grit and perseverance
   through the difficulties and challenges of leadership.
5. **Growth mindset vs. Fixed Mindset.** We are creatures of habit and have a
   tendency to do things the way that it has always been done, but the problem
   is that in this ever-changing world, a fixed mindset will leave us stuck;
   therefore, Globalplex will help train in strengthening a growth mindset and
   create opportunities for adaptation and progress.
