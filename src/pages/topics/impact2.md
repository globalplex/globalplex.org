## IMPACT - Mission of the Team

### Why

- **According to a McKinsey report, 97% of employees and executives believe lack
  of alignment within a team impacts the outcome of a task or project.**

Alignment in vision, mission, and goals of a team are essential to
accomplishing a team's purpose. In many organizations, the mission of the team
is carried and championed only by a small group of people at the top, which
leads to lack of ownership and purpose for the rest of the team members. In
order for teams to reach their full potential and maximize its impact, teams
need to be moving in the same direction and all members are moving in that
direction together.

Although most teams would agree on the importance of aligned missions, many
teams are unable to bring their purpose in alignment effectively. Our training
will assess the alignment of teams, uncover the gaps that exist in teams that
cause misalignment, and provide solutions for teams to be on the same page for
their mission.

### What We Offer

#### Frameworks for Team Missions

After assessment of the team's mission alignment, our training will cover first
and foremost the importance and tools to help teams define and delineate their
vision, mission, and goals. We will touch upon the differences between the
three, as well as introduce the understanding of a team's "essential intent"
which helps define the focus of the team's projects and responsibilities.
Often, team members are unable to align themselves to missions and purposes
because they simply cannot articulate them or they cannot tell the difference
between the many vision, mission, or value statements that are set forth by the
top leaders. In our training, we will equip each member of the team with
frameworks to understand and verbalize the frameworks for team missions.

#### Structures for Team Empowerment

Having mission statements alone is not enough to help teams accomplish their
mission. Each team member of specific teams needs to understand how their
specific role and responsibilities contribute to that mission. Without this
connection, team members can find their work purposeless and mundane. In our
training, we will provide structures and frameworks for teams for most
effective delegation and empowerment of each of its team members to accomplish
the team's overall mission.
