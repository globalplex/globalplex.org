## GROWTH - Optimization of Skills and Talents

### Why

Half of us will need to re-skill in the next five years, as the
"double-disruption" of the economic impacts of the pandemic and increasing
automation transforming jobs takes hold.

The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2025, 85 million jobs may be
displaced by a shift in the division of labor between humans and machines. But
the very technological disruption that is transforming jobs can also provide
the key to creating them - 97 million â€“ may emerge that are more adapted to the
new division of labor between humans, machines and algorithms.Greater adoption
of technology will mean in-demand skills across jobs change over the next five
years, and skills gaps will continue to be high.
