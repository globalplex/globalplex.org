      title: Head of Technology & Development
      subtitle: Upspring Purification Technology Ltd., HK
      blurb: Methodical and appropriate.
      description: Entrepreneurship is an area that I was tremendously influenced by. Previously, the fear of failure was always something that held me back from pursuing my dreams. From the training I receivedout making them feeling discouraged. Ultimately, it is his oratory prowess, professional yet with a personal touch, perfected into a sublime concoction, which proves so effective in leading many others, like myself, to achieve our high, I learned to overcome that fear by placing my self-worth on something greater than achievements, circumstances or people. Doing so has liberated me to explore new opportunities and endeavors that I never believe was possible.

      title: Associate Professor
      subtitle: Bucknell University
      blurb: Success is measured by whom you impact.
      description: It's difficult for me to overstate the impact that Seth Kim has on my life both professionally and personally. Through my formative years in graduate school, Seth was a mentor, teacher, and friend and through his investment in my life, I grew to be a leader. I believe one of the greatest attributes of a leader is that success is measured by whom you impact. As a professor, sometimes this impact is obscured because our greatest legacy is our students and their imprint on the world. That my role is to serve my students so that they would surpass me almost seems counterintuitive, yet I find that it motivates me to faithfulness and diligence.
