      title: Senior Branch Manager - Wealth Management
      subtitle: Manulife HK
      blurb: Seth showed me the importance of 'doing things differently'.
      description: Seth has always been a great mentor since I started my career as a university graduate, especially when I switched from being a journalist to a wealth management advisor two years ago. It was not easy to be in an industry that I did not study for, which at the same time, was highly competitive. Seth showed me the importance of 'do things differently', which even if I am younger compared to my coworker, I was able to leave memorable impressions to my clients. Also, he always focused on 'the growth mindset' which keeps me motivated for a longer and greater vision instead of short-term achievements.

      blurb: I have also learned to persevere and have grit in the journey to change.
      description: One of the biggest lessons in the past few years working with Seth was to adopt the growth mindset. While everyone has strengths and weaknesses, I tend to magnify my shortcomings and linger in my failures. Seth, again and again, encourages me to accept my areas of growth and provides me with tangible next steps to see small wins in the process. Have I ever thought of giving up? Yes, I have. Nonetheless, I have also learned to persevere and have grit in the journey to change.

      blurb: Stretching oneself towards a goal is the crucible for one's development.
      description: One Leadership/Character trait that Seth has facilitated in me over the years is being true to who I am and standing firm for what I believe. Stretching oneself towards a goal is the crucible for one's development. Seth enables has helped me learn that lesson through successes and failures by keeping focus of the end goal.
