Doing so has liberated me to explore new opportunities and endeavors that I never believe was possible.

        title: Associate Professor
        subtitle: Bucknell University
        blurb: Success is measured by whom you impact.
        description: It's difficult for me to overstate the impact that Seth Kim has on my life both professionally and personally. Through my formative years in graduate school, Seth was a mentor, teacher, and friend and through his investment in my life, I grew to be a leader. I believe one of the greatest attributes of a leader is that success is measured by whom you impact. As a professor, sometimes this impact is obscured because our greatest legacy is our students and their imprint on the world. That my role is to serve my students so that they would surpass me almost seems counterintuitive, yet I find that it motivates me to faithfulness and diligence.

        description: One of the biggest lessons in the past few years working with Seth was to adopt the growth mindset. While everyone has strengths and weaknesses, I tend to magnify my shortcomings and linger in my failures.

Nonetheless, I have also learned to persevere and have grit in the journey to change.

        title: Architecture Student
        subtitle: University of Hong Kong
        blurb: Leadership is about growing the people and meeting them where they are.
        description: Before I was exposed to the Global Plex curriculum, I've always thought that onboarding people to a vision is a leader's most important and difficult duty. However, after a year under GPlex's training, I realized that leadership is mostly about growing the people in our organization and meeting them where they are at so they too can pass down the vision. One training session about creating and capitalizing on teaching moments really inspired me. We were given principles on how to help people process character-exposing moments in their lives and make next steps to improve. I learned to apply this in a recycling initiative my peers and I started in our Architecture Department at university.

        title: Senior Branch Manager - Wealth Management
        subtitle: Manulife HK
        blurb: Seth showed me the importance of 'doing things differently'.
        description: Seth has always been a great mentor since I started my career as a university graduate, especially when I switched from being a journalist to a wealth management advisor two years ago. It was not easy to be in an industry that I did not study for, which at the same time, was highly competitive. Seth showed me the importance of 'do things differently', which even if I am younger compared to my coworker, I was able to leave memorable impressions to my clients. Also, he always focused on 'the growth mindset' which keeps me motivated for a longer and greater vision instead of short-term achievements.
